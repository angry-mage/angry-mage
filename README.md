- 👋 Hi, I’m @angry-mage
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, video games (development and enjoyment!), baking, and art (I prefer digital media but I mostly work in traditional!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development at Keyin, we're covering topics like Python, Java, JavaScript, postgreSQL and MongoDB for data stores, Node.js, Express, and more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that require a working knowledge in any of the above mentioned languages / techs, but I'd love to learn by working too!
- 📫 The best way to reach me would be via email @ jayeagles519@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Moths are my favourite animal besides cats!
